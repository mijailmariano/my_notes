    "\n",
    "Lists can be created with **list comprehensions**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - This is a shorthand way to specify what elements should be in a list\n",

    "- all Python functions have a (return value) whether explicit or implicit\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arguments and Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- an argument is the value a function is called with\n",
    "\n",
    "- a parameter is part of a function's definition; a placeholder for an argument\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "can think of \"parameters\" as \"placeholders\" for a future argument either you or user will input manually\n",
    "\n",
    "    for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        def add(a, b):\n",
    "        \n",
    "        result = a + b  #where 'a' and 'b' are placeholders for future inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "        return result\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    x = 3\n",

    "    print(add(x, 7))\n",
    "\n",
    "    will return = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Default Values\n",
    "\n",
    "you can also set default values when defining/creating variables\n",
    "\n",
    "    for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def sayhello(name=\"World\", greeting=\"Hello\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "        return '{}, {}!'.format(greeting, name)\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "    when calling the function, if no values are passed in the parameters -- then, default \"hello world\" will be returned\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- note that when arguments are specified in this way we say they are \"keyword arguments\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- thus, their order does not matter\n",
    "\n",
    "- the only restriction is that keyword arguments must come after any positional arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python provides a way to unpack either a list or a dictionary to use them as function arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the * operator in front of a list makes as though we had used each element in the list as an argument to the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The order of the elements in the list will be the order that they are passed as positional arguments to the function\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Scope is a term that describes where a variable can be referenced. \n",

    "    If a variable is in-scope, then you can reference it, if it is out-of-scope then you cannot\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Variables created inside of a function are local variables and are only in scope inside of the function they are defined in\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Variables created outside of functions are global variables and are accessible inside of any function\n",
    "    \n",
    "We can access global variables from anywhere\n",
    "\n",
    "for examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    n = 123 (global variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "    vs. \n",
    "\n",
    "    (local variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def new_function(): \n",
    "\n",
    "        n = 7  (local variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "        return n\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lambda Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is a function that accepts 0 or more inputs, and only executes a single return statement (note the return keyword is implied and not required)\n",
    "\n",
    "    used as \"throw-away\" functions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "so for instance...\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Map Function \n",

    "\n",
    "### Creating \"Series\" in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python: Dict, List\n",
    "\n",
    "    - [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numpy - arrays\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - np.array([1, 2, 4, 5])\n",
    "    - really fast and efficient \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas - Series (1D), Dataframes(2D)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - built on 'numpy' \n",
    "    - series also have index\n",
    "    - you CANNOT pass mutiple character types into a series\n",
    "    - universal type is 'object'\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vectorized \n",
    "\n",
    "Like numpy arrays, pandas series are vectorized by default, for example, we can easily use the basic arithmatic operators to manipulate every element in the series\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison Operators also work...\n",
    "\n",
    "    - example series:\n",
    "\n",
    "    numbers_series == 17\n",
    "\n",
    "    returns...\n",
    "\n",
    "        0    False\n",
    "        1    False\n",
    "        2    False\n",

    "        4     True\n",
    "        dtype: bool\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Series Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes return useful information about a Series' properties; they don't perform operations or calculations with the Series. Attributes are easily accessible using dot notation\n",
    "\n",
    "    ATTRIBUTE EXAMPLES:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - .index\n",
    "        - .values (returns the data within the series...specific to int/float types)\n",
    "        - .dtype\n",
    "        - .name (you can 'name' a series...useful when working with dataframes & series)\n",
    "        - .size\n",
    "        - .shape\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook allows you to quickly access a list of available attributes by pressing the tab key after the series name followed by a period or dot; this is called dot notation or attribute access\n",

    "There are several components that make up a pandas Series, and I can easliy access each component by using attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Series Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods used on pandas Series objects often return new Series objects; most also offer parameters with default settings designed to keep the user from mutating the original Series objects. (inplace=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If I want to save any manipulations or transformations I make on my Series, I can either assign the Series to a variable or adjust my parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Series have a number of useful methods that we can use for various sorts of manipulations and transformations; let's look at a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - specific to 'catergorical' types; \n",
    "\n",
    "    for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pd.Series(['a', 'b', 'c', 'a']).values_count()\n",
    "\n",
    "    will return:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a  2\n",
    "    b  1\n",
    "    c  1\n",
    "\n",
    "        Function\tDescription\n",
    "        count:\tNumber of non-NA observations\n",
    "        sum:\tSum of values\n",
    "        mean:\tMean of values\n",
    "        median:\tArithmetic median of values\n",
    "        min:\tMinimum\n",
    "        max:\tMaximum\n",
    "        mode:\tMode\n",
    "        abs:\tAbsolute Value\n",
    "        std:\tBessel-corrected sample standard deviation\n",
    "        quantile:\tSample quantile (value at %)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    ".nlargest, .nsmallest\n",
    "\n",
    "    These methods allow me to return the n largest or n smallest values from a pandas Series. I can set the keep parameter to first, last, or all to deal with duplicate largest or smallest values; this is quite handy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing and Subsetting\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is where the pandas index shines; we can select subsets of our data using index labels, index position, or boolean sequences (list, array, Series).\n",
    "\n",
    "    I can also pass a sequence of boolean values to the indexing operator, []; that sequence could be a list or array, but it can also be another pandas Series if the index of the boolean Series matches the original Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "combining 'indexing' and 'boolean masking'\n",
    "\n",
    "    example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    INDEXING:  bool = number_series > 10\n",
    "    \n",
    "    BOOLEAN MASKING: number_series[bool]\n",
    "\n",
    "    will return:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a series of all numbers > than 10 in the 'original' number_series\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### String specific Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    ".str\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In addition to vectorized arithmetic operations, pandas also provides us with a way to vectorize string manipulation. Once we access the .str attribute, we can apply a string method to each string value in a Series. \n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Performing string manipulation like this does not mutate my original Series; I have to assign my manipulation to a variable if I want to keep it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, we can call the .lower method, which will convert each string value in the string_series to lowercase\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More Series Methods\n",
    "\n",
    ".any, .all\n",
    "\n",
    "    We can use the .any method to check if any value in the series is True, and .all, to check if every value in a Series is True. Both methods return a boolean value denoting whether the condition is met\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, we could check to see if there are any negative values in a Series like this\n",
    "\n",
    ".isin\n",
    "\n",
    "    The .isin method can be used to tell whether each element in a Series matches an element in a passed sequence of values. For example, if we have a Series of letters, we could use .isin to tell whether each letter is a vowel.\n",
    "\n",
    ".apply\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sometimes there are more complicated operations that we want to perform, and we need to apply a function to each element in a Series. In this case, we can define a function that handles a single value and use the .apply method to apply the function to each element in a Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "        - can also be used to 'pass' Lambda functions\n",
    "\n",
    "            Here we define a function, even_or_odd, then reference that function when we call .apply. \n",
    "            \n",
    "            Notice that when we reference the even_or_odd function, we are not calling the function, rather, we are passing the even_or_odd function itself to the .apply method as an argument, which pandas will then call on every element of the Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "            It is also very common to see lambda functions used along with .apply. We could re-write the above example with a lambda function like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "                numbers_series.apply(lambda n: 'even' if n % 2 == 0 else 'odd')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pandas 'Bins'\n",
    "\n",
    "    bin continuous data to convert it to categorical data. We will look at two different ways to accomplish binning below\n",
    "\n",
    "    pd.cut(s, bins=n)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - We can either specify the number of bins to create, and pandas will create bins of equal size, or we can specify the bin edges ourselves by passing a list of bin edges or cutoffs\n",
    "\n",
    "        - bin 'cutoffs':\n",
    "\n",
    "        - bin 'edges':\n",

    "* outlier: an observation point that is distant from other observations https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/outliers-to-drop-or-not-to-drop/\n",

    "\n",
    "* data errors: drop the rows/observations with the errors, correct them to what it was intended\n",
    "\n",
    "* address text normalization issues...e.g. deck 'C' 'c'. (correct and standardize the text)\n",
    "\n",
    "* tidy data: getting your data in the shape it needs to be for modeling and exploring. every row should be an observation and every column should be a feature/attribute/variable. You want 1 observation per row, and 1 row per observation. If you want to predict a customer churn, each row should be a customer and each customer should be on only 1 row. (address duplicates, aggregate, melt, reshape, ...)\n",

    "* creating new variables out of existing variables (e.g. z = x - y)\n",

    "* scale numeric data: so that continuous variables have the same weight, are on the same units, if algorithm will be used that will be affected by the differing weights, or if data needs to be scaled to a gaussian/normal distribution for statistical testing. (linear scalers and non-linear scalers)\n",
    "----\n",
    "**3. Split the data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* split our data into train, validate and test sample dataframes\n",

    "* validate, test: represents future, unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "* validate: confirm our top models have not overfit, test our top n models on unseen data. Using validate performance results, we pick the top 1 model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* test: out-of-sample, how we expect our top model to perform in production, on unseen data in the future. ONLY USED ON 1 MODEL.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You want to do all the prep that can be done on the full dataset before you split. Go through, work on DF for all you need to, then move to train when it's time. So you don't have to go back and forth, because leads to errors and inconsistencies in data.\n",
